I initially started with a workforce of 600 and 800, then varied based on the outcomes to find the optimal workforce. As the experiment progressed, I adjusted the workforce based on whether the production was above or below the target range on the previous day. This adaptive strategy helped me optimize production levels.

I initially started by making small adjustments to the workforce based on the historical production results. As the experiment progressed, I adjusted the workforce size based on whether the production was below or above the target range. However, hitting the target consistently proved to be a challenge, as small changes could sometimes result in significant production variations.
